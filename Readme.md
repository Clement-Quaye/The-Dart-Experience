I got infected by the flutter hype too :D! BUT, As I  walked through building projects with professional developer online; I realized I could be better if I did due diligence and picked up some knowledge in the Programming language behind the new wave.

This repo is digital journal of my experience studying Dart for a better Flutter experience!

It is categorized into two (2):
